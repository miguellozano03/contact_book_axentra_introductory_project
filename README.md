# Contact Book Project

This project was created for the AxentraOS internship induction. It follows the required structure provided by "fast_api_struct.zip". I'm glad to share you the exercise I developed.

## Quick Start

I have included automation scripts to handle environment setup, dependency installation, and server startup in one go.

### Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
### Windows

```
run.bat
```

## 📖 API Documentation
Once the server is running, you can explore and test the API at:
